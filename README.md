This project let me develop my skills associated with web designing. I wanted to acquaint with essential concept of using "web tools". 
At that time I was't aware of Bootstramp tool, therefore I made my web corresponsive only by CSS.
Nowadays I would like to perform more advanced project (using React, node.js, PHP). Due to "MyWebsite" I realized I like that field of IT.
You can find that website under the "wisłarząska.pl" (it was not my idea to use polish signs in adress).
